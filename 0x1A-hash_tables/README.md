In C programming, a hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or "key") and returns a fixed-size string of characters, typically a numerical value, which is often a hash code. The primary purpose of a hash function is to map data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size value, typically for the purpose of indexing or searching in data structures like hash tables.
Hash functions are commonly used in data structures like hash tables to efficiently store and retrieve data. They work by taking an input, processing it using the hash function, and then storing or looking up data based on the resulting hash code.

The objectives of this project is to make me understand

What is a hash function
What makes a good hash function
What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
What are the most common use cases of hash tables
