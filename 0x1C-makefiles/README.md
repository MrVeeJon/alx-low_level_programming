A Makefile is a special file used in software development to manage the build process of a project. It contains a set of rules and dependencies that specify how the source code of a program should be compiled and linked to create the executable or library.

The primary purpose of a Makefile is to automate the build process by defining a set of instructions and dependencies. This way, developers can avoid manually compiling and linking all the source files every time they make changes to the code. Makefiles are commonly used in projects where there are multiple source files, and changes to one file may require recompilation of others.

A typical Makefile consists of rules, each specifying a target, dependencies, and commands to be executed
