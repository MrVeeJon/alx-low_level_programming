0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

A search algorithm is a method or a set of rules used to find a specific item or element in a collection of data. In computer science, these algorithms are crucial for efficiently locating information within data structures, such as arrays, lists, or databases.

Linear Search:

In a linear search, also known as a sequential search, each element in the data structure is checked one by one until the desired item is found or the entire collection is searched.
It is simple and easy to implement but may not be efficient for large datasets since it checks elements one at a time.

Binary Search:

Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that works on sorted arrays or lists.
It involves dividing the search space in half at each step, comparing the target value with the middle element, and eliminating half of the remaining elements based on the result.
Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), making it significantly faster than linear search for large datasets.
